# tuanng-site

This is the code to my personal site https://www.tuanng.io. It will be under permanent construction :)

### Plan

- A blog page will be added, using a database and a markdown rendering library.

- At some point I'll also add a photo library. I love photography.

### Some useful things:

- On a Mac, to get local IP address, type:

```
 ifconfig | grep broadcast
```

and then you should see something like this

```
inet 192.168.2.27 netmask 0xffffff00 broadcast 192.168.2.255
```

Use the first address, followed by the port, to access your local site from
another device.
